# QRCodeVersion1
QR Code generator using a link, saved onto a folder using Python. Not using a visual app.

This constantly asks you if you want to create another QR Code after generating one in the terminal. You can say y/n to terminate the program or keep it moving.
File path can be changed - I just set my file_path = f"E:\\Coding\\Qr Code Generator\\Qr Code Images\\{file_path_name}.png"
This was when I was using my PC, so this was useful for me.
This project was created as a joke, to find a picture of my friends face on LinkedIn and just convert the link into a QR Code that I can just randomly send on Discord so when they open it, it shows their face. 
This can have ulterior purposes such as advertising something in University for extra information. For now, this serves no purpose.
